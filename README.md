# Demolition Engine

hi, welcome to yet, another modified version of Psych Engine, where we add lots of shit that the engine devs will not add, probably lmao.

###### i decided to release this earlier than the mod itself, just to give you all a little sneaky peeky/teaser of what the mod will have in store

## Rules for Discussions:

- Don’t hate on others, be respectful of others.
- Do not make spam posts, I will just remove them.
- Showcase your stuff, code, art, anything that relates to FNF, and maybe give us ideas of what to add.
- Dave & Bambi stuff is okay, but please, don’t flood the discussions with them. :(
- Ask for help, but don’t beg for it, it gets annoying.
- Joke posts are okay, but please don’t do what I just said not to do under the 2nd bullet…

## Origins of Engine:

This was originally used for a mod titled "Friday Night Funkin: Graveyard Rush", you can go download and play it on GameJolt Here:
